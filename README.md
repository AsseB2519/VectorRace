# VectorRace

</div>

The theme of this project was **Problem Solving - Search Algorithm**. It was explicitly crafted to cultivate awareness and address challenges through the conception and implementation of search algorithms for solving a game named **[VectorRace](https://harmmade.com/vectorracer/)** (also known as RaceTrack) - a simplified car simulation game featuring a predefined set of moves and corresponding rules.

<h3>Implemented Algorithms:</h3>
<p>This project implemented several search algorithms to solve the game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A* (A-Star)</li>
  <li>Greedy </li>
  <li>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</li>
  <li>Depth-First Search (DFS)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiplayer Option:</h3>
<p>In addition to implementing various search algorithms, the project also incorporated a multiplayer option, allowing multiple players to compete using different algorithms in different maps.</p>

<h3>User Interface:</h3>
<p>Developed a GUI where the players could see the result of the game: </p>
